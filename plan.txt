executive summary
  - why the new api is better
  - plan for migration

new endpoints intro
  - quick overview of all new endpoints
  - dedicated slide for add endpoint and create conversation endpoint

proposed migration:
 - all shown in one slide with magic move
 - 1. show original /v2/complete endpoint wrapped in a generate() function, taking a conversation_id and bot_id
 - 2. then, we morph it into the add endpoint instead, changing converswation_id to user_id
 - 3. but! a conversation must be created first. show how to create a conversation beforehand. highlight create_user_if_not_exists
- 4.  show how it's possible to add a message right after conversation creation with an add call. add one bot messsage with an image attached as the starting conversation
- 5.  now, replace that add call with the equivalent with_messages parameter to show a start message from the bot with an image.
 - 6. but, it's possible that a conversation already exists. show check for an existing conversation, and if that conversation does exist, we use that conversation id, isntead of the one we created.
 7. finally, add another parameter to generate, that has a list of messages and the conversation doesn't exist, we can use with_messages to create that conversation, otherwsie, we can use with_messages to create a starting conversation, otherwise, we can use the existing conversation

 so the final pseudo code would be something like, obviously replaced with the corresponding rest endpoints. make your code example be in python:
 generate(message, user_id, bot_id, existing_messages?) {
  existing_conv = get conv (user id, bot id)
  if existing conv exists, use it
  new conv = if existing messages then new conv (with_messages=...) else new conv (with_messages={bot:true attached_media=...})

  add_messages(conv, message)
  // wait for response in webhook
 }
